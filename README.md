Some formal structure around vibing - the wise way
Wise Vibing: Taming Your AI Coder for Real Results (Even If You're Not a Code Ninja)
We're living in the age of AI coding assistants. Tools like GitHub Copilot, Claude via Augment Code, Gemini, and others promise to revolutionize software development, turning weeks of coding into minutes. The hype is real. But let's be honest, so is the frustration.
How many times have you started a project with an AI assistant, only to find it losing the plot halfway through? It forgets requirements, mangles the architecture, or gets stuck in a loop fixing the same trivial bug. This chaotic, sometimes hopeful, sometimes disastrous process has even been dubbed "vibe coding."
What Was "Vibe Coding" Anyway?
The term popped up around February 2024, and attributed to Andrej Karpathy. His initial description painted a picture of almost blind trust in the AI: accept all suggestions, barely read the diffs, paste errors back in, and hope for the best. It was about catching the "vibe" of the desired outcome and letting the AI handle the messy details.
While fun for experimental projects, relying purely on this "vibe" for anything complex quickly leads to tangled, unmaintainable code. Why? Because current LLMs, despite their vast knowledge, struggle mightily with context and memory. They forget the grand plan, the subtle dependencies, the decisions made hours or even minutes ago.
This is where what I call Wise Vibing comes in. It's not about ditching the incredible power of AI assistants; it's about strategically guiding them. It's a methodology born from the realization that turning a concept over to an LLM and expecting a perfect outcome isn't realistic... yet. But with the right structure, even those of us who aren't seasoned coders can leverage these tools for extraordinary productivity.
Wise Vibing: Beyond the Buzzword – Starting with Strategy
My journey into Wise Vibing didn't start with code; it started with conversation. I realized that the tendency for AI coders to get lost mirrors challenges I've seen managing highly specialized human teams. You don't just throw a vague goal at experts and walk away; you facilitate discussion, define boundaries, and ensure everyone's aligned.
Phase 1: The LLM as Strategic Consultant (Not Yet Coder)
Before writing a single line of code, I engage an advanced LLM (like Gemini 1.5 Pro) as a planning partner.
1.	Present the Concept: Clearly outline the project goals.
2.	Solicit High-Level Feedback: Ask about potential challenges, common architectures, alternative approaches. This leverages the LLM's massive training data to pressure-test the idea.
3.	Critically Evaluate: Remember, it's generating probable text, not truly thinking. Watch for conventional suggestions, hallucinations, and context gaps.
4.	Mandate Modularity: This is crucial. I explicitly instruct the LLM: "Outline a high-level, modular structure..." This forces the project into smaller, manageable chunks designed to fit within the coding LLM's limited context window later.
The output isn't a perfect spec, but a refined, modular blueprint informed by the LLM's knowledge and structured to mitigate its weaknesses. You don't need to be a master architect yourself; you guide the LLM to create a structure that works for the AI coding process.
Phase 2: Orchestrating the LLM Dialogue – Achieving Synchronization
Different LLMs have slightly different "perspectives." The plan conceived by Gemini might not perfectly mesh with the internal biases of the coding LLM (like Claude via Augment Code).
So, I become the conductor, facilitating a moderated dialogue:
1.	Present the [Gemini] designed Plan to Coder LLM: Show the blueprint and ask for implementation feedback.
2.	Cross-Pollinate: Feed the coding LLM's suggestions back to the planning LLM. "The coder suggested X, how does this fit?"
3.	Inject Human Insight: This is vital. I don't just copy-paste. I challenge assumptions ("Is that library scalable?"), amplify good points, and extend ideas based on the project's real-world constraints.
My Role: Throughout this, I often don't understand the deep technical intricacies being discussed between the LLMs. My background managing experts smarter than me in their domains I am sure has helped here. Keep the "boffins" (LLMs) focused on the high-level objectives, ensuring their detailed discussions lead towards our goal, even if I don't grasp every cog and code snippet. The goal is conceptual synchronization – ensuring the coding LLM has effectively "bought into" and helped shape the plan it will later implement.
Phase 3: The .vibe.md Spec – The AI's Work Order
With a synchronized plan, we break it down. To combat the LLM's context drift during coding, we use Vibe Block Specifications (.vibe.md files). Think of these as detailed contracts for each module, designed specifically for an LLM coder.
Stored typically in docs/vibe_blocks/, each .vibe.md contains:
•	Metadata: BlockID, Version, Status, Owner.
•	Purpose: A concise statement of responsibility (critical for anchoring the LLM).
•	LLMSummary: A tiny summary for quick reference.
•	Interface (Provides/Consumes): The core contract – functions, methods, events, data needed and offered.
•	Dependencies: Explicit list of other Vibe Block IDs it relies on.
•	(Optional) State Management, Key Abstractions, Constraints, Usage Notes.
Before finalizing a .vibe.md, we show the draft to the coding LLM and ask: "Is this clear? Can you implement this? Any ambiguities?" Again, it's about ensuring the entity doing the work understands and contributes to the instructions.
I didn't invent the specific fields in this template; it evolved through the back-and-forth with the LLMs themselves. What's important isn't my deep understanding of every detail within it, but the singularity of understanding it creates between the planning context, the coding LLM, and the task at hand.
I have an example vibe block template at: https://github.com/robwise888/Wise-Vibing
Phase 4: development_rules.md – The Constitution for Quality
A good spec prevents chaos, but doesn't guarantee quality. We need standards for consistency, maintainability, and testing – especially with AI generating code rapidly.
Enter development_rules.md, our project's constitution. Crucially, like the .vibe.md, we involve the coding LLM in defining these rules.
Why?
•	"Buy-in": Framing rules based on the LLM's own articulated best practices makes enforcement feel less arbitrary. (Yes, I know LLMs don't "feel," but aligning with its probable pathways seems to help!)
•	Clarity Check: If it can explain the rule, it understands the concept.
•	Foundation for Self-Correction: Pointing it back to rules it helped define is a powerful corrective.
Our rules cover:
•	Directory Structure: Strict separation (core, dev, tests).
•	Naming Conventions: Consistency is key.
•	Documentation: Docstrings, READMEs mandatory.
•	Code Quality: No duplication, complexity limits, PEP 8.
•	Testing Discipline: Unit tests, coverage minimums.
•	Workflow: Adherence to architecture, managing capabilities.
•	Compatibility & Separation: Checks for integration and future deployment.
Enforcement: Periodically, we explicitly tell the coding LLM: "Re-read development_rules.md. Review the code you just generated against these rules. Report violations and suggest fixes." This structured self-reflection is key.
Again an example of some development rules developed my LLMs are to be found at  repo: https://github.com/robwise888/Wise-Vibing)
NOW We Code (or Rather, Supervise)
With the plan synchronized, specs defined, and rules established, the actual coding becomes surprisingly smooth.
1.	Feed the Spec: "Okay, please read IDENTITY_SYSTEM_V1.vibe.md."
2.	Add Context: Paste in any relevant notes or high-level goals for this specific module that were part of the discussion that you feel were important to refresh.
3.	Generate: Let the AI generate the code based on the spec.
4.	Integrate: Ask the LLM to review previously coded modules for necessary integration points and ensure the new code fits. Ask if because of the review if anything needs to be added to the previous code modules or to the module just completed. Inevitably there are gaps found and remedied.
5.	Rule Check: Periodically invoke the "review against development_rules.md" process.
Does this planning take time? Yes. Is it worth it? Absolutely. When you see weeks of potential coding effort condensed into minutes or hours of supervised generation, with far less debugging and architectural confusion, you'll be thankful. I recently used this to build a project with distinct pipelines and shared global modules – components I only clearly identified during the LLM planning dialogues!
Why Wise Vibing 
This structured approach isn't for large teams or expert architects. It provides the scaffolding that allows less experienced coders, or those managing projects without deep technical expertise in every area, to:
•	Leverage the vast knowledge of LLMs effectively.
•	Mitigate the primary weaknesses (context loss, architectural drift) of current AI assistants.
•	Maintain quality and consistency.
•	Tackle complex projects with confidence.
Wise Vibing transforms the interaction from a hopeful gamble into a strategic partnership. It’s less about blindly "following the vibes" and more about conducting the AI orchestra with a clear score, ensuring the final symphony matches your vision.
